# Startup Most Recent Game
Decided that I wanted to have a shortcut on my desktop to start up my most recently played Steam game.
Hopefully a non-horrific implementation of that?

## How it works
Create a txt called key in the same folder as the executable and paste your Steam API key into it.
Edit data.txt and replace the value of "steamid" with your [steamid](https://steamid.xyz/).
Run the exe! It should work. A shortcut to your most recently played game should be created on the desktop.
