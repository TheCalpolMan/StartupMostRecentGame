# Steam Shortcut
Decided that I wanted to have a shortcut on my desktop to start up my most recently played Steam game.
Hopefully a non-horrific implementation of that?

# How to make it work
## Automatic Method
Run config.exe, fill in the fields and press save!<br>
You'll need your [steam web API key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and your [steamid](https://steamid.xyz/)

## Manual Method
Create a txt called key in the same folder as the executable and paste your [steam web API key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) key into it.<br>
Edit data.txt and replace the value of "steamid" with your [steamid](https://steamid.xyz/).<br>
Run the exe! It should work. A shortcut to your most recently played game should be created on the desktop.
